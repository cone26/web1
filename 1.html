<p><strong>Leading Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny says he believes
  President Vladimir Putin was responsible for his poisoning.</strong></p>
<p>"I assert that Putin is behind this act, I don't see any other explanation,
  " he told German news magazine Der Spiegel in an interview.
Germany, where Mr Navalny is recovering, says he was poisoned by a Novichok
nerve agent. Its findings were confirmed by labs in France and Sweden.
The Kremlin denies any involvement.
